Demo1 for using C# and Xamarin.Forms. The supported UI platforms are Android, Windows UWP, and iOS.
</h2>
<p>
ZAG generated a source tree containing customized demo apps
using a Portable Class Library core, and platform specific apps
to host the Xamarin.Forms pages.
These apps will help you get started using the ZSS Client SDK
and edit your data from various devices.
</p>
<p>
Either Xamarin Studio or Visual Studio can be used to compile 
and run the code. Some project files need certain Visual Studio
versions to compile.  Any unsupported project types can be 
ignored.
</p>
<p>
These projects rely on NuGet to download the Xamarin and Zumero 
dependencies.  It may download an older version, and you can install 
any dependency updates by following the <a href=http://docs.nuget.org/docs/start-here/using-the-package-manager-console#Updating_a_Package>NuGet update instructions</a>.

<h3>App Highlights</h3>
<p>
This app contains:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>A "Sync" button on the ActionBar 
  that will connect to your ZSS Server and sync your local
  ZSS database with the MSSQL database on the server.</li>
 <li>A full authentication dialog.<br/>
  (<i>This version shows all of the various authentication
  fields for debugging purposes.  In your production app,
  you may want to hard-code various fields and omit some of these
  fields from the dialog.</i>)
  </li>
 <li>A "Tables" button on the ActionBar of the Welcome Page
  that will show you a list of all of tables that were present in the
  database when this app was generated.
  Clicking on an individual table from this list will show you
  a roughly formatted list containing rows from the table.
  Clicking on a row from this list will show you a detailed
  view of that row in the database.</li>
 <li>Insert and Update functionality to make changes in the app
  that can be Synced up to the server.</li>
 <li>A Revert Changes button that will let you undo all changes
  that have been made in the app since the last Sync.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The source code illustrates the following concepts:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A functional ZumeroSync demo showing the use of the Zumero Client
    SDK for Xamarin.Forms on Android, iOS and Windows UWP using C# and Xamarin Studio.</li>
  <li>Use of a custom class for each SQL table that knows about the table schema.</li>
  <li>INSERT and UPDATE operations to modify data in the local SQLite database.</li>
  <li>Custom column formatting routines that know about column datatypes.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The source code does not handle:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Database operations for DELETE.</li>
  <li>Custom display widgets using column type information,
  such as a date/time picker.</li>
  <li>Joins</li>
</ul>

<h3>Database Information</h3>
<p>
This demo app includes the following tables from your ZSS database.
The left column lists the table names as they exist in the SQLite database.
The middle column lists the corresponding name used in the source code
of the demo app; this alternate name is used only when the sql table name contains
characters not allowed in variables or filenames.

<h3>Build Prerequisites (Android)</h3>
<p>
You also need Xamarin Studio 5 to build this demo for Android.
This is available from <a href="http://xamarin.com/">http://xamarin.com/</a>.
</p>
<p>
You will also need either a paid or trial license for Xamarin Studio
because the generated demo app calls native SQLite routines.
</p>


<h3>Build Prerequisites (iOS)</h3>
<p>
To build this iOS app for iPhone/iPad you will need
an OS X system running 10.8 or 10.9 and Xcode 5.
These are now available from the OS X App Store.
</p>
<p>
You will also need Xamarin Studio 5.
This is available from <a href="http://xamarin.com/">http://xamarin.com/</a>.
</p>
<p>
You will also need either a paid or trial license for Xamarin Studio
because the generated demo app calls native SQLite routines.
</p>


<h3>Build Instructions</h3>
<p>
Launch Xamarin Studio by double-clicking on:
</p>
<pre>
  C:\Users\jeremy\Downloads\zag_3.3.0.1129_windows(1)\demo.zssdemo\demo1__xamarin.forms\demo.sln
</pre>
<p>
You should always be able to build and run the app
in the iOS Simulator.  To run it on an actual iOS device
you will need to be a Registered Apple Developer.
</p>

<p>

<h3>Errors</h3>
<p>
Xamarin Studio may report errors when building or running a newly
generated project.  Here are some common reasons:
</p>

<center>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="1" width="80%">
<tr>
<td valign="top">iOS</td>
<td valign="top">
  <tt><b>IOHIDLib __dealloc</b></tt>
  <p>
  You may get the following error messages in the Xamarin Studio
  application output window when running the app in the 7.1
  iOS simulator.  These are believed to be a problem in an
  Apple system library and may be ignored.
  </p>
<pre>
  /System/Library/Extensions/IOHIDFamily.kext/Contents/
  PlugIns/IOHIDLib.plugin/Contents/MacOS/IOHIDLib:
  dlopen(/System/Library/Extensions/IOHIDFamily.kext/Contents/
  PlugIns/IOHIDLib.plugin/Contents/MacOS/IOHIDLib, 262):
  Symbol not found: __dealloc Referenced
